# Healthcheck Worker Removal Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to remove the Healthcheck Worker endpoints from the Admin API as part of ticket ADMINAPI-1295. These changes were implemented to streamline the API and remove features that were no longer needed.

## Components Removed

The following components were removed from the codebase:

1. **Healthcheck Worker Endpoints**:
   * Healthcheck worker-specific endpoints in the Admin API
   * Associated route registrations and handlers

2. **Scopes**:
   * Any specialized scopes related to healthcheck worker functionality
   * Authorization policies specific to healthcheck workers

## Restoring Functionality (If Needed)

If the Healthcheck Worker functionality needs to be restored in the future, follow these steps:

1. **Revert the Git Commit**:

   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```

   Where `<commit-hash>` is the commit hash for the ADMINAPI-1295 changes.

2. **Alternative: Cherry-Pick Previous Implementation**:
   If you need to selectively restore parts of the healthcheck worker functionality:

   ```bash
   git checkout <pre-change-commit> -- Application/EdFi.Ods.AdminApi.AdminConsole/Features/Healthcheck/
   ```

## Testing After Restoration

1. **API Functionality**:
   * Test healthcheck worker endpoints
   * Verify they respond with expected data

2. **Integration Testing**:
   * Verify that healthcheck worker functionality works properly with client applications
