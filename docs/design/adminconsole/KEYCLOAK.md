# Keycloak Configuration

> [!INFO]
> Detailed notes to be filled out, replacing these bullet points.
>
> * Should make sure we can configure Keycloak once for use both by Admin API
>   and by Admin Console.
> * Review the configuration script used by the  Data Management Service. Maybe
>   create a Docker container for Ed-Fi Keycloak with shared settings already in
>   place.
> * Need to describe how to create the role for the worker processes, which
>   allows them to access client credentials via the `/adminconsole/instances`
>   endpoint.
